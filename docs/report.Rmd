## My analysis

I modeled the relationship between height and shoots two ways: 1) by log-transforming the response and 2) with log-normal errors.  Here I compare the two approaches:

```{r}
tar_load(summary_table)
summary_table %>% arrange(AIC)
```

As you can see, model 1 (with log-transformed response) has a lower AIC but I don't know if these are comparable because the two models are fit to different data!!!

Instead, let's look at model diagnostics

#### Log-transformed:

```{r}
plot(tar_read(log_lm), c(1,2))
```

#### Log-normal

```{r}
plot(tar_read(log_link_glm), c(1,2))
```

The log transformed response model also has better behaved residuals.
