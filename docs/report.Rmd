```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## My analysis

I modeled the relationship between height and shoots two ways: 1) by log-transforming the response and 2) with log-normal errors.  Here I compare the two approaches:

```{r}
tar_load(summary_df)
summary_df %>% select(model, AIC, BIC, df = df.residual)
```

As you can see, model 1 (with log-transformed response) has a lower AIC but I don't know if these are comparable because the two models are fit to different data!!!

Instead, let's look at model diagnostics

#### Log-transformed:

```{r}
plot(tar_read(m1), c(1,2))
```
#### Log-normal

```{r}
plot(tar_read(m2), c(1,2))
```
