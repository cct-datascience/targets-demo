# targets-demo

This repo is intended as a minimal demo of using the [`targets` R
package](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) for workflow management
using data from the `palmerpenguins` package. 

## Instructions

1. Check out the files and code in `data/` and `R/`
2. Load the `targets` package with `library(targets)`
3. Run `use_targets()`
4. Edit `_targets.R`

Check out the
[manual](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html#inspect-the-pipeline)
for instructions on how to run the pipeline.

The "solution" can be found in the ["with-targets" branch](https://github.com/cct-datascience/targets-demo/tree/with-targets).
